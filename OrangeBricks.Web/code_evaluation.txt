Code Evaluation

Action Items:

1) Create a README that explains the following things:
	A) Installation of the project. 
		1) One of the first things I noticed when opening the solution was that I needed to have SQL Server 2012 installed. Ideally, a README would explain this dependency ahead of time, in addition to any other dependencies that I would need to install.
		2) The Nunit Test Adapter dependency needed to be installed to run unit tests
		3) Note: in order to run unit tests I had to install Nunit3TestAdapter plugin and I had to resolve the missing System.Web.Helpers reference
			a) I upgraded NUnit to v3 from v2 in order to be able to run unit tests with Nunit3TestAdapter plugin
	B) How to use the website
		1) Instructions explaining how to get set up as a buyer and seller. Although it is intuitive to click the Get Started button on the homepage to get started in a general sense, it's not immediately intuitive that you need to click this button in order to get set up as a buyer and seller specifically.
	C) Project structure
		1) A detailed breakdown of the structure of the project.
